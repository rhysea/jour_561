# USC - JOUR 561


This folder contains my data, demos, sample code and assignments for spring 2022!

Those with evil intentions, you'll be banished (if I find out, that is).







Notes you probably don't want to read:

Please **pull** the latest notebooks and data from here each week when you get into class.

**Commit** your work to personal repos.
